# Optimising F1 Car Dynamics for Maximum Exit Speed at Turn 2 of Albert Park Circuit

## Project Description and Significance
This project leverages advanced simulation data to optimize F1 car dynamics at crucial turns of the Albert Park Circuit. By meticulously analyzing telemetry and positional data, we develop strategic insights that enhance car performance, specifically aiming to maximize exit speed from Turn 2, which is critical for lap time improvement.

## Challenges and Data Source
F1 cars generate vast amounts of telemetry data, which can be complex to analyze due to the intricate dynamics involved in racing. This project uses detailed simulation data from the 2022-2023 F1 seasons provided by Oracle and Red Bull Racing. This rich dataset includes real-time car performance metrics which are essential for developing a nuanced understanding of vehicle dynamics under various racing conditions.

## Previous Work
Previous methodologies typically focused on broader data analysis without deep dives into specific track segments. This project refines the approach by using Oracleâ€™s cloud computing power to perform real-time and predictive analytics, focusing on critical track segments for strategic enhancements.

## Project Goals and Dataset Utilization
The primary goal is to provide race strategists and engineers with data-driven insights to optimize throttle, braking, and steering settings for improved race performance. We process and analyze telemetry data, focusing on car behavior in Turns 1 and 2 of the Albert Park Circuit, where precise handling and speed transition are crucial.

## Data Handling and Analysis
- **Data Preparation**: Compilation and synchronization of multiple data sources from recent F1 seasons to ensure comprehensive coverage of all relevant metrics.
- **Detailed Cleaning and Feature Selection**: Emphasis on extracting and refining features that directly impact car performance during specific track segments.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis to uncover patterns in car behavior and identify potential areas for dynamic improvement.

## Data Description
The dataset includes telemetry data such as speed, throttle positions, braking intensity, and steering angles across various laps and sessions. This data is segmented specifically around Turns 1 and 2, providing a focused view on car dynamics where strategic interventions can yield significant time improvements on the lap.

## Usage
The insights derived from this project are crucial for:
- **Race Strategy Development**: Enabling strategists to tailor race plans based on predictive models of car performance.
- **Performance Optimization**: Engineers can fine-tune car settings for specific track conditions, potentially leading to significant advantages in race conditions.


- **Modelling Section**: Detailed modelling strategies and results will be added to further elaborate on the predictive aspects of the project, focusing on optimizing inputs for car settings during critical race segments.
