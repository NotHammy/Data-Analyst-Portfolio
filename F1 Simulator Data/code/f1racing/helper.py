    """
    Generates segmented data for F1 simulation analysis between specified start and end points.

    This function extracts data from segments of an F1 car's lap between two intersection points. 
    It calculates key metrics such as speed, throttle, brake, and relative distance from a reference line at specified intervals.

    Args:
        f1sim_car_df (pd.DataFrame): Dataframe containing F1 simulation data, including car position, speed, throttle, and braking information.
        intersection_points1 (dict): Dictionary of intersection points (start) for each lap, with lap IDs as keys and car positions as values.
        intersection_points2 (dict): Dictionary of intersection points (end) for each lap, with lap IDs as keys and car positions as values.
        f1sim_line (pd.DataFrame): Dataframe containing the reference line data, including 'WORLDPOSX' and 'WORLDPOSY' columns.
        segment_name (str, optional): Name of the segment, used for labeling output keys (e.g., "TURN1"). Default is an empty string.
        offset_start (float, optional): Distance to adjust the start point in meters. Positive values move the start point forward. Default is 0.
        offset_end (float, optional): Distance to adjust the end point in meters. Positive values move the end point forward. Default is 0.
        interval_samples (int, optional): Number of samples (points) to generate between start and end points. Default is 10.
        segment_num (int, optional): Segment number that determines how start and end points are selected:
            - 1: Start from minimum LAP_DISTANCE, end at the intersection point.
            - 2 or 4: Start and end at the first intersection point.
            - 3 or 5: Start at the second intersection point, end at the first intersection point.

    Returns:
        tuple: 
            - segment_dict (dict): A dictionary where each lap ID is a key containing segment data such as brake, throttle, speed, distance from reference line, and lap distance for each sampled interval.
            - points_for_graphing (list): A list of car position coordinates (WORLDPOSX, WORLDPOSY) for visualizing the segment path.
