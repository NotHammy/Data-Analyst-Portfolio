Project Overview: 
Analyzing Student Enrollment Trends for Targeted Advertising
  
Objective
This project leverages educational data to optimize advertising strategies for an online education platform, focusing on academically ambitious students, athletes, performers, and traveling students.

Data
We utilized a dataset tracking student populations across various schools in Australia from 2020 to present, examining changes in enrollments and the average percentage change over time. This dataset also included ICSEA percentiles, facilitating an analysis of socio-educational advantages.

Analysis
Enrollment Trends: Calculated the percentage change in enrollments within schools over several years, identifying schools with significant growth as potential advertising targets.
ICSEA Analysis: By correlating the average ICSEA percentile of schools with enrollment changes, we aimed to determine if socioeconomic status influences school population stability.
Key Findings
Enrollment Stability: Schools in high ICSEA areas showed stable enrollments, suggesting these areas might not be ideal for aggressive advertising due to already satisfied parental choices.
Targeting High Growth Schools: Schools with the fastest enrollment growth were identified as potential targets, particularly those fitting the platform’s student profile.
ICSEA and Enrollment Changes: No direct correlation was found between the ICSEA percentile and the rate of enrollment change, indicating that both high and low ICSEA schools experienced similar growth rates.
Hypotheses
High ICSEA regions have stable populations, potentially leading to consistent enrollments.
Schools with a high percentage of top SEA quarter students offer a promising target for advertisements, aligning with the platform’s focus on academically driven individuals.
Tools and Techniques
Data was processed and analyzed using SQL and Python, focusing on handling null values correctly to ensure accurate percentage calculations.
Visualization of data was planned through scatter plots to depict changes in student population over time.
Conclusion
The analysis provides a nuanced understanding of where and how to target potential students for the online education platform, using data-driven insights to potentially improve enrollment strategies.
