# Crimson Global Academy Enrollment Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project is focused on identifying optimal advertising targets for Crimson Global Academy by analyzing key demographic and enrollment data from 2020 to the present. By leveraging detailed insights into student populations and socio-economic statuses, the analysis highlights potential student groups that might be most responsive to the academyâ€™s unique educational offerings.

## Objectives
Identify Target Demographics: Determine which groups of students, such as academically ambitious individuals, athletes, performers, and families who travel frequently, are likely candidates for the academy's programs.
Analyze Enrollment Trends: Examine changes in school enrollments over time to understand demographic shifts and potential growth areas.
Optimize Advertising Strategies: Utilize findings to inform and refine advertising strategies tailored to specific student groups and regions with the most potential for enrollment growth.
## Data Handling and Analysis
Data Cleaning: Initial data containing enrollment figures from 2020 onwards was adjusted to exclude erroneous zero values from the initial year, ensuring more accurate calculations.
SQL Queries: Employed SQL for data manipulation, focusing on accurately calculating average percentage changes in enrollments without the skewed data from the year 2020.
Insights: Analysis revealed that high ICSEA scores do not correlate with significant changes in enrollment, guiding advertising efforts towards schools with a higher percentage of students in the top socio-educational quartile.
## Key Findings
Stable High ICSEA Areas: Areas with high ICSEA scores tend to have stable enrollment numbers, suggesting limited potential for significant growth through advertising.
Target Richer Demographics: Schools with high socio-educational advantages, typically private schools, present a promising target for outreach, holding a concentration of the academy's desired demographics.
## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis to support data-driven decisions in advertising for educational services, enhancing understanding of demographic trends and improving outreach efficacy.
