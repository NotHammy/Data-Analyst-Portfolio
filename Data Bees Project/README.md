This project aims to identify effective advertising targets for Crimson Global Academy by analyzing changes in school enrollments and ICSEA percentiles from 2020 to present. Utilizing data on student population dynamics and financial statuses, the analysis provides insights into which student groups might be most responsive to the academyâ€™s offerings. Target groups include academically ambitious students, athletes, performers, and traveling families. The study uses SQL to manage data on enrollment changes, correctly adjusting calculations by omitting flawed initial year data. Key findings suggest that areas with high ICSEA scores do not correlate with significant changes in enrollment, thereby guiding advertising efforts towards schools with a higher percentage of top socio-educational students. This project not only addresses data-driven decision-making in educational advertising but also improves accuracy in longitudinal enrollment studies.
