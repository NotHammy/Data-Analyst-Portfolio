# Online Educational Institute Advertising Locations

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify optimal advertising targets for Crimson Global Academy by analyzing demographic and enrollment data from 2020 to the present. With a focus on leveraging deep insights into student populations and socio-economic statuses, our analysis pinpoints potential student groups that might be most responsive to the academy's unique educational offerings.

## Objectives
- **Identify Target Demographics:** Pinpoint specific groups of students—such as academically ambitious students, athletes, performers, and families who often travel—who are ideal candidates for the academy's programs.
- **Analyze Enrollment Trends:** Investigate changes in school enrollments over recent years to discern demographic shifts and pinpoint emerging opportunities for enrollment growth.
- **Optimize Advertising Strategies:** Use the derived insights to craft and refine advertising strategies that are precisely tailored to engage specific student groups and geographic areas demonstrating the highest potential for new enrollments.

## Data Handling and Analysis
- **Data Cleaning:** The analysis began with the refinement of enrollment data from 2020 onwards, removing erroneous zero entries from the initial dataset to ensure the accuracy of subsequent calculations.
- **SQL Queries:** SQL was utilized for robust data manipulation, focusing on precise calculations of average percentage changes in enrollments, adjusted to mitigate the distortive impact of the initial skewed data from 2020.
- **Insight Extraction:** The analysis uncovered that high ICSEA (Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage) scores do not necessarily correlate with significant enrollment changes. This insight directed our advertising focus towards schools within the top socio-educational quartiles, where enrollment is more stable yet under-targeted.

## Key Findings
- **Stability in High ICSEA Areas:** Regions with high ICSEA scores generally exhibit stable enrollment figures, suggesting these areas may not be conducive to aggressive advertising strategies aimed at increasing student numbers.
- **Focus on Affluent Demographics:** Schools that cater to students from socio-economically advantaged backgrounds, particularly private schools, emerge as promising targets for advertising. These institutions typically house a higher concentration of students fitting the academy's ideal demographic profile.

## Conclusion
The analysis conducted provides a robust foundation for data-driven decision-making in advertising strategies for educational services. By enhancing our understanding of demographic trends and identifying the most fruitful avenues for outreach, this project significantly improves the efficacy of targeted advertising efforts.
